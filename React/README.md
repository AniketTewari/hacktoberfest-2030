##Using React in our Web Application 

In this folder, I am keeping the React code, which is basically for using React in our Web Application without using the npx create-react-app command. 

Here, I am using the the CDN files from React documentation and then importing them and using them to show some things in our output for this exercise. 

Feel free, to contribute or suggest any changes if required from the code perspective.
